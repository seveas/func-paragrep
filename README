Paragrep -- parallel log grepper using func
===========================================

FUNC (https://fedorahosted.org/func/) is a modular remote execution daemon.
Paragrep uses func for parallel log searching. It consists of two parts: the
func module you need to deploy to all your servers and a frontend application
that queries this module. You use the frontend on your func master.

paragrep supports func delegation and will automatically parallelize 100% to
get results as quick as possible.

Usage:

paragrep --help
paragrep [opts] [host_spec] [regexp] [file_spec]

Paragrep accept many of grep's options and adds two of its own: -z and -j zo
use zgrep resp. bzgrep instead of grep. --help lists all supported options.

host_spec accepts anything func understands, that is semicolon-separated globs
that match server names. Don't forget to quote them in the shell.

file_spec is a list of files or file globs. Globs will be expanded on the
remote end if you quote them properly.

Example invocations:

paragrep 'webserver-*.example.com;ntp-server-*.example.com' root /var/log/secure*
paragrep -z 'webserver-*' login.py /var/log/httpd/access_log*gz
